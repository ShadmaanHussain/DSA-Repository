**The most important concepts in trees - Any problem is to be viewed using Recursion or Level-Wise Traversal (Where queue is used)**

## Traversals

 - Pre-Order - Root then child
	 - depth wise
	 - level wise
- Post-Order - First child then root (Destructor of the treenode is doing postorder traversal)
